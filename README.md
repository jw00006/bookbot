## BookBot
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Is a command-line application in Python that does static analysis on text files, in this case, Project Gutenberg's "Frankenstein," by Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley.
#### Prints a report of ... 
- The total number of words used
- A complete list of alphabetic characters found within the document
  - Along with the number of times each character was used

### Boot.dev
